"""Tier 2: the same durable pause, in REAL LangGraph — interrupt() + a
checkpointer, resumed by thread_id, surviving a simulated process restart.

    make test-integration

The graph under test is `hitl.approval_graph`, in src/, which is yours. This file
only supplies a checkpointer and a place to record sends; every assertion here is
about code you wrote. It used to build the graph itself, which made the real
implementation something you read rather than something you had to get right.

Runs offline: the graph's nodes are deterministic functions, no model involved.
