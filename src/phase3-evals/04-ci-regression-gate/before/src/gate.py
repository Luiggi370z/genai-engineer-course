"""TODO: turn a results file into an exit code.

`make gate` must fail for four different reasons, because they are four different
bugs:

  1. an **absolute bar** breach — the system isn't good enough, full stop;
  2. a **regression** against the committed baseline beyond `TOLERANCE` — a bar alone
     lets you rot from 0.94 to 0.86 with every PR passing;
  3. a **per-slice** regression — overall 0.86 can hide the unanswerable slice
     collapsing from 1.00 to 0.40, or a slice disappearing entirely;
  4. **instrument drift** — a different judge model, temperature or RAGAS version
     means the numbers are not comparable. That is a re-baseline, and it belongs in
     a reviewed commit.

Everything here is pure logic over two JSON files: no model, no network, no excuse
not to run it on every push.
