"""A RAG pipeline with ONE planted bug — the single most common one in the wild.

SYMPTOM: retrieval quality is garbage. Not "slightly worse" — nonsense results,
even for questions whose answer is verbatim in the corpus. Your eval's
context_recall cratered.

Debug it with the back-to-front playbook:
  1. Is the answer ignoring its context?      -> generation/prompt
  2. Is the right doc retrieved at all?       -> retrieval
  3. Is the doc even in the index?            -> ingestion
  4. Retrieved but ranked low / buried?       -> ranking / rerank

`make test` — one test fails. Find it, fix src/rag.py, get it green.
Diagnosis afterwards in ../after/README.md.

(Embedders are injected so this runs offline and deterministically. The bug is
exactly the one you'd hit with real models.)
