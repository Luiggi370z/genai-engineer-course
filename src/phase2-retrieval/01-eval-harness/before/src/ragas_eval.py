"""TODO (tier 2): the REAL RAGAS evaluation.

    from openai import AsyncOpenAI
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory
    from ragas.metrics.collections import ContextRecall, Faithfulness

Verified against **ragas 0.4.3** (2026-07-31). The metric classes live in
`ragas.metrics.collections` and take a judge built by `llm_factory` over an
`AsyncOpenAI` client. If a tutorial hands you `from ragas.metrics import
Faithfulness` with `evaluate()` and `EvaluationDataset`, that is the pre-0.4
surface: it still imports, it raises a DeprecationWarning, and it will not match
what lesson 3.2 teaches. Metrics score ONE sample at a time via `score(...)`, so
you average across the golden set yourself.

- local_judge(): a FREE judge on Ollama (base_url=http://localhost:11434/v1),
  temperature=0. PIN IT — the judge is part of the ruler.
- as_score(value, metric): validate one verdict before it enters an average.
- aggregate(scored): per-row scores to the two means a gate reads.
- run_ragas(golden, pipeline, judge): score every row, return `aggregate`'s result.
- gate(scores): fail under faithfulness 0.85 / context_recall 0.80.

`as_score` and `aggregate` are separate functions on purpose, and `tests/test_gate.py`
is why: it tests both by the number, offline, with no judge and no `ragas` installed.
That only works because the ragas imports live INSIDE the functions that use them.
Do the same in your own harness — the arithmetic between a judge's verdict and a
merge decision is the part you can test properly, and it is the part that fails
quietly.

Run with: make test-integration (tier 2) or make test (tests/test_gate.py, always)

    Return `value` as a float in 0..1, and raise `ValueError` naming `metric` when
    it is not one. Three inputs to reject, and the middle one is the reason this
    function exists rather than being a `float()` call at the call site:

      * `None` — the judge did not answer. Reading that as 0.0 turns a broken judge
        into a quality regression, and sends someone to debug the retriever.
      * `NaN` — a NaN compares False against every threshold, so `nan < 0.85` is
        False and the gate PASSES. Worse, one NaN row makes the whole mean NaN, so
        a single unparsed verdict silences the gate for the entire run while the
        report still prints a number.
      * outside 0..1 — usually 0..100, because `rapidfuzz` returns percentages and
        RAGAS returns fractions. A faithfulness of 87.0 clears a 0.85 bar by two
        orders of magnitude and reads as a triumph.

    `tests/test_gate.py` has all three, and they are worth reading before you
    write this: they run offline, so you get them green in a second rather than
    after a nightly."""

    its first row has produced no evidence, so return 0.0 for both and let the gate
