"""Tier 2's arithmetic, tested without tier 2's judge.

`test_integration.py` needs Ollama, a multi-gigabyte model and a few minutes, so
it runs nightly and asserts almost nothing: that the keys exist and that `gate`
returns a bool and a list. That is a connectivity check wearing the costume of a
quality gate. Anything it *could* assert about the numbers would be
non-deterministic anyway — a judge is a language model, and pinning its
temperature to 0 makes it repeatable, not predictable.

So the numbers get tested here instead, on the two pure functions that stand
between a judge's verdict and a merge decision. No judge, no network, no RAGAS
install: `src/ragas_eval.py` imports ragas lazily inside the functions that need
it, which is what makes this file possible and is worth copying.

What each test below is protecting:

  * `aggregate` — a mean over rows. Cheap to get wrong in a way that reads fine.
  * `as_score` — the guard on a judge's output. The NaN case is the one that
    matters: a NaN average compares False against every bar, so a gate holding
    one is a gate that has stopped gating and still prints a number.
  * `gate` — the bars. Tested AT the boundary in both directions, because `<` and
    `<=` look identical in every passing run and differ on exactly the value a
    team argues about.
