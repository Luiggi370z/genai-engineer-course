    This used to check that `"faithfulness" in scores` and that `gate` returned a
    bool and a list — true of a function that returns `{"faithfulness": 0.0}` and
    of one that returns nothing at all. It passed while proving only that the
    imports resolved.

    A judge's exact values are not predictable even at temperature 0, so what is
    asserted here is what a judge must manage on this input rather than a specific
    score. `_pipeline` answers three questions using their own ground truth as the
    only retrieved context: every claim in the answer is supported and the
    reference is fully covered. If a pinned judge cannot clear the bars on that, the
    finding is about the judge, and finding that out is the point of running it.

    The arithmetic between a verdict and a merge decision is tested in
    `test_gate.py`, offline and by the number — including the boundary cases and
    the NaN a live run will not produce on demand.
