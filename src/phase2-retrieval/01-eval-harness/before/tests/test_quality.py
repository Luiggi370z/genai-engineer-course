    Six rows is what this repo ships — three semantic, two exact, one unanswerable.
    Enough to prove the harness loads, scores, slices and gates; nowhere near enough
    to gate a real system on. The assignment is to grow it to thirty over your own
    corpus, so `== 6` would mean doing the assignment turns this suite red, and the
    lesson a red suite teaches is "do not add questions". Ten per slice is roughly
    where a slice mean stops being anecdote; at one row, the unanswerable slice is
    either 0.0 or 1.0 and nothing in between.

    What IS pinned is the shape: all three slices present, the unanswerable one
    included, because that is the slice people quietly drop when their abstention
    path starts failing.
