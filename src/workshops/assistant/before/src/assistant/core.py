"""The assistant itself — one pipeline, two delivery modes.

`Assistant` owns the request pipeline: screen the input, remember it, retrieve
and re-screen context, run the tool loop under a trace, then compose. `ask()`
returns the answer in one piece; `ask_stream()` yields it as SSE frames. Both
build on the same `_gather` so policy can never diverge between the two paths.

Every stage of that pipeline opens a child span (observe.py). This is not
decoration. "The P99 is 4 seconds" is not a finding, it is the start of an
argument; "the P99 is 4 seconds and 3.6 of them are in `llm.compose`" ends it.

Your TODOs here are recall (`Assistant.recall`, TODO 2), ingest-time screening
(`Assistant.ingest`, TODO 3), the shared pipeline (`Assistant._gather`, TODO 4),
the observability seams (TODO 5-8) and the abandoned stream (TODO 9); ask() and
ask_stream() are given and build on all of them. Tool SELECTION is no longer one
of them — it moved to planner.py, where it can read the registry instead of a
hardcoded list of names. Keep everything offline and deterministic — the adapters
that make it real are chosen in service.py, and the HTTP surface lives in api.py.

`forget()` and `evidence()` are given, and they are short because the hard part
is one layer down (adapters.py, TODO 4-7). They are here to make the point that
a retrieval layer is not finished when search works: a corpus you cannot delete
from will eventually hold something you are not allowed to keep, and a citation
that cannot be resolved back to its text is decoration.

        `forget()` below audits its delete and it would be easy to leave the add
        unaudited by symmetry with "nothing was removed": the asymmetry is the
        bug. A document that lands in the corpus changes every answer the tenant
        gets from then on, and when one of those answers turns out to be wrong,
        the question is who put the source there — unanswerable if only removals
        were written down. A screen that did not object is not the same thing as
        a document nobody has to account for.

        Return `{"ingested": added, "rejected": n}` — the caller is entitled to
        know that half its batch did not make it. Wrap the whole thing in an
        `observe.stage(..., observe.INGEST_SPAN)` carrying SUBJECT, TENANT,
        INGEST_ACCEPTED, INGEST_REJECTED and the CORPUS_VERSION of what was
        kept: "how much of that batch was refused" is a question you will be
        asked in an incident, and counting it afterwards is not possible.

        A document arrives as prose OR as `{"text": ..., "source": ...}`, and
        the source has to survive screening. It is what a citation points at and
        what `forget(source)` deletes, so a redacted document that lost its name
        is a document nobody can attribute or withdraw — which is a quiet
        incentive to screen less. Pass the source through with the cleaned text.

        Retrieval-time screening (`screen_contexts`) already drops a poisoned
        document on its way to the composer, so this looks redundant. It is not,
        for three reasons.

        A payload that is only caught at retrieval is *stored*: it sits in the
        index, it comes back in every search that ranks it, and it is one
        detector regression away from being evidence. Storing it also means the
        blast radius of a later bug is the whole corpus rather than one request.

        PII is the second reason, and it is the sharper one. Redacting at
        retrieval keeps the raw SSN on disk forever; redacting at ingest means
        it was never written down. That is data minimisation, and it is the
        difference between a breach that exposes what you needed and one that
        exposes what you happened to keep.

        Third: the caller finds out. An `/ingest` that silently drops half a
        batch and reports success is how a corpus quietly ends up incomplete.

        None of which retires `screen_contexts` — documents can arrive by paths
        that never touch this method, and a detector that improves tomorrow has
        to be applied to what was written yesterday. Two gates, one screen.

        parent — so the whole request reads back as a tree.

        - self.screen() the input under SCREEN_SPAN, recording SCREEN_BLOCKED and
          (when blocked) SCREEN_REASON; if blocked, record ("policy.blocked",
          subject, reason) in self.audit_log and return {"blocked": reason}

          tenant=subject) — which returns CHUNKS now, not strings — and pass
          them through `screening.screen_chunks(hits, self.screen)`. A poisoned
          document is dropped BEFORE it becomes evidence, and passing self.screen
          is what makes the guard model cover this channel too. Record
          RETRIEVAL_K, RETRIEVAL_HITS *and* RETRIEVAL_KEPT: the gap between the
          last two is how many documents the screen threw away, which is a
          security signal one number cannot show. RETRIEVAL_SOURCES (the sorted
          set of `chunk.source`) is what turns "retrieval was slow" into "the
          slow ones all hit the same document".

          Keep BOTH shapes: `rag.texts(chunks)` for the composer and the planner,
          which only want words, and the chunks themselves under "chunks", which
          is what `citations_for` needs to produce a citation somebody can check.
        - call `deadline.check()` (import it) BETWEEN the stages. Python cannot safely
          interrupt work in flight, so the honest thing a pipeline can do is
          refuse to start the NEXT stage — which turns an unbounded request into
          a bounded one and unwinds from a point where nothing is half-applied.
          It also catches the caller who gave up while an earlier stage ran:
          retrieval and a model call for an answer nobody will read are the most
          expensive possible way to be polite.
        - run agent.run under observe.traced_run with a registry wrapped by
          `screening.harden_registry(self.base_registry, self.screen)` (your
          TODO 1), then `outbox.recorded_registry(..., self.outbox, subject,
          observe.request_id())`, then observe.traced_registry. Three wrappers,
          outside-in, and the order is the design: screening is innermost so it
          sees raw tool output, the outbox sits outside it so the intent is
          durable before anything runs, and tracing is outermost so a span covers
          the whole thing including the write.
          `decide=planner.registry_brain(contexts, registry, capture)` — note it
          takes the WRAPPED registry, so a discovered MCP tool is selectable and
          still screened,
          a `capture` composer that RECORDS its state argument and returns ""
          (the callers compose afterwards), and `consume=` a callable that spends
          one of THIS subject's grants for the exact call:
              lambda name, args: self.approvals.consume(subject, name, args)
          Pass `consume`, not an `approvals` allow-list: the grant has to be taken
          against the arguments actually about to run.
        - audit-log every entry in `result.calls` as ("tool.ran", subject, X),
          passing `approval_id=` and `args=call.args` so the row can be joined
          on rather than read. Iterate `result.calls`, not the "ran: " strings
