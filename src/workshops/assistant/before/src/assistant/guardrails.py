"""Workshop 6 layer — harden the assistant. Containment, not wishful filtering.

L1 decode+squash+scan+redact on every untrusted string (incl. fetched emails and
news), spotlight untrusted content, and an output gate. Combined with the agent's
HITL + least-privilege tools, a landed injection still can't fire a gated tool.

The scan has two surfaces, because attackers work in two ways.

**Expansion** answers "what else does this text say?" — base64, percent-encoding
and HTML entities all let a payload travel as something that does not look like
a payload. Append each decoding rather than substituting it, so decoding can only
ever ADD evidence; a document that legitimately contains a base64 blob must not
be rewritten out from under the person who later reads it.

**Squashing** answers "what does this text say if you stop respecting the
separators?" `1gn0re`, `i g n o r e`, `Ign<zero-width-space>ore` and `IGNORE` are
one word to a human and four different strings to a regex.

Neither half makes the filter complete, and the bar is not "no injection ever
lands" — that bar cannot be met. The bar is that a landed injection cannot fire
an irreversible tool or leak PII, which is HITL's job, not this file's. What this
file buys is that the cheap obfuscations stop working.
