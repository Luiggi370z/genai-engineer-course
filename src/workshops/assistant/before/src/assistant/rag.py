"""Workshop 2 layer — a small hybrid-retrieval RAG core the assistant can query.

Self-contained (offline) BM25 + bag-of-words dense, fused with RRF — the same
shape as phase2/02-hybrid-rerank, now a reusable component. Swap the store for
Qdrant + real embeddings in production; the interface stays put.

What the store holds is a **chunk**, not a string, and that distinction is the
whole difference between a demo and something you can operate. A chunk knows
where it came from (`source`), which revision of that source it is (`version`),
which slice of it it is (`ordinal`, `start`, `end`) and what its identity is
(`id`). Each of those exists because of a question a string cannot answer:

- *"Where did this claim come from?"* — a citation that says "rag" tells a user
  nothing they can check. One that names a source and a character range does.
- *"The policy page changed; is the answer stale?"* — the version stamp says so.
- *"Delete everything from that document."* — you cannot delete by prose.
- *"We re-ingested the corpus and now every answer cites four copies."* — an id
  derived from `(tenant, source, ordinal)` makes a re-ingest an UPDATE. An
  auto-incrementing counter makes it a duplicate, every single time.

A chunk carries text and not a vector: how it is embedded is the store's
business (`adapters.py`), and the offline store does not embed at all.
