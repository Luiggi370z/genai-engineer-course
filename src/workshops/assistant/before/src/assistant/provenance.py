"""TODO: which system produced this number — derived, never typed.

Two consumers, one answer: `core.py` stamps the prompt version onto every
compose span, and `report.py` stamps model/prompt/corpus/dataset onto the report
the merge gate reads. They agree because they call the same functions.

The rule this file exists to enforce: **a version stamp is computed from the
thing it describes.** The alternative — `PROMPT_VERSION = "v3"` next to the
prompt — rots the first time someone edits the prompt in a hurry, and it rots
silently. Nothing fails, no test goes red; the label just stops being true, and
every comparison across that boundary quietly becomes a comparison between two
different systems wearing the same name.

    `/health` reports it and a post-deploy smoke check compares it to the SHA it
    just shipped. Without it the nastiest deploy failure is invisible: a rollout
    that half-finished, leaving an old machine in the pool. It is healthy, it
    answers correctly, and every other check passes against it.

def source_id() -> str:
    """TODO 6: a stable name for the code and data a measurement was taken against.

    The same rule as every stamp above, one level up: `build_version` says which
    commit is *serving*, this says which source was *measured*. `release.yml` reads
    it out of the committed evidence and refuses to publish a tag whose tree answers
    differently — so a release cannot quote numbers taken against other code.

    Return four different things, and the distinctions are the exercise:

      ``<8 hex>``         `digest` over `"<path>=<oid>"` for each MEASURED_SOURCE
                          entry, where the oid is `git rev-parse HEAD:src/<path>`.
                          Hash the git object ids, NOT the commit sha — the evidence
                          has to be committed to the release it certifies, and a
                          commit sha changes when the evidence file lands while a
                          tree hash of the measured paths does not.
      ``dirty-<8 hex>``   when `git status --porcelain` reports anything under those
                          paths. Prefix the same digest rather than returning a
                          separate flag: a gate that compares ids cannot forget to
                          also check a boolean, and this id matches nothing.
                          Careful — a pathspec resolves against the cwd, so use the
                          `:/` root-relative form or a clean tree will read dirty.
      ``release-<sha12>`` no git, but `SRC / "RELEASE_COMMIT"` exists — the ZIP
                          lane, where `package.sh` wrote the release's own commit.
      ``unbound``         neither. Never invent a value here: an id that compares
                          equal to a real one is worse than admitting you have none.

    `_git` below is written for you; the judgement being tested is what to hash.
