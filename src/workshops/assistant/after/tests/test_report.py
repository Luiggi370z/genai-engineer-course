"""The portfolio page is generated evidence, so the generator itself is on trial.

If `make report` can emit a page that hides a containment breach or invents a
number, the portfolio is worse than none. These tests run the real builder against
the real offline assistant and check the page carries measured content — and that
a breach cannot pass silently.

The JSON half is held to a harder standard than the page, because CI acts on it
without a human in the loop: the stamps must be derived rather than typed, the
numbers must move when the system moves, and a breach must show up as a bypass
count the merge gate can block on.
