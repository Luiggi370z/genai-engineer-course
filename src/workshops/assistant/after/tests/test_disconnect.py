"""A client that hangs up, over a real socket.

Every other cancellation test in this suite installs the signal by hand —
`deadline.budget(cancelled=lambda: ...)` around the generator — and proves the
pipeline obeys it. That is worth proving and it is not the same claim. The claim a
caller cares about is that *closing a connection* sets that signal, and the two came
apart completely: the middleware started a disconnect watcher, called the route, and
cancelled the watcher in a `finally`. For a streaming response `call_next` returns
before a single byte of the body is sent, so the watcher was always cancelled before
the client could possibly leave. Twenty tests green, and `deadline.expired()` inside a
live generation returned `None` for a caller who had already gone.

**Why these tests assert on the mechanism and not on a chunk count.** The obvious
assertion — "the source stops being pulled" — was already true before the fix, and
for a reason that has nothing to do with this service. Starlette hands the middleware
its chunks over a zero-buffer anyio stream, so when Uvicorn's transport dies the
producer's `send` breaks and the generator is collected. Measured: 57 of 400 chunks
before the fix, 43 after. A test asserting `< 400` passes on the broken code.

That accident is not the contract, and the difference is not cosmetic:

  * it is a torn-down coroutine, not a cancellation. `deadline.check()` never fires,
    so the 499 path in `api.expired` never runs and nothing is recorded about a
    request that was abandoned rather than answered;
  * it depends on buffer sizing and transport behaviour in two libraries. Give the
    memory stream a buffer, or run behind a server that swallows writes to a dead
    socket, and generation continues to the last token;
  * it cannot reach anything else that reads the flag. `deadline.capped` shrinking a
    composer timeout, a tool refusing to start — all of it stays asleep.

So the assertion is `deadline.expired()`, asked from inside the running model. That is
the signal the rest of the codebase is built on, and it is the one that was missing.

Not marked `integration`: no Qdrant, no Ollama, no key. `uvicorn` is a runtime
dependency of the service, so the fast tier already has it. It is still the slowest
test here by an order of magnitude, because a socket is the only instrument that can
observe this — `TestClient` reads the whole response and `httpx.ASGITransport` does
not model a mid-response close.
