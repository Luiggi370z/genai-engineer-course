"""Regression tests for the three defects — reference versions.

Every test here must FAIL when its defect is seeded (`DEFECT=...`) and PASS
against the current code. `make defect-lab` enforces both directions, in that
order, because a regression test that has never been red is a regression test
you know nothing about.

Note what is *not* asserted. None of these reaches for an implementation
detail — no counting of SQL statements, no checking that `ApprovalStore` has a
`_lock`. They state the property a user cares about: Bob cannot spend Alice's
approval; two racing requests send one message; nothing crosses the boundary
before the gate sees it; the image is built from a pinned lockfile. A test
written against the fix rather than the property goes green on the next
refactor and stays green through the next regression.
