"""Workshop 8 layer — OpenTelemetry around the agent loop and every tool.

An agent is harder to observe than a single model call, because the interesting
question is never "how long did that take". It is *what did it do* — which tools,
in what order, how many steps, and where the eight seconds actually went. A single
timer on `run()` cannot answer any of that; a span tree can.

Three design choices worth copying:

**Tools are instrumented by wrapping the registry, not by editing tools.** No tool
knows it is being traced, which means adding a tool cannot forget to. Cross-cutting
concerns belong at the seam, not sprinkled through every implementation.

**One span per stage, under one root.** A single `agent.run` span answers "how
long" and nothing else. When a request is slow, the question is *which stage* —
the screen, retrieval, memory, the model, a tool, the output gate — and a flat
span cannot say. The tree here is deliberate: `assistant.request` at the HTTP
door, `auth.verify` and `assistant.pipeline` beneath it, and one child per stage
beneath that. A P99 you cannot decompose is a number you cannot act on.

**The vendor is an environment variable.** These are plain OTel spans — using
OpenInference and OTel semantic-convention names where they exist and
clearly-marked custom names where they do not — so Langfuse, Phoenix or your
existing APM all read them. The service identity travels as a Resource, not as a
tracer name, because that is the field every backend groups by. The in-memory
exporter used in tests is the same code path as production.
