"""What a request consumed, and what that costs.

One meter, used twice: `core.py` puts these numbers on the compose span, and
`report.py` totals them for the CI cost gate. Two meters would be two answers to
"what did last week cost", and the interesting week is always the one where they
disagree.

The price table is `crew.PRICE` — the same tiers the Phase-5 crew routes across —
rather than a second copy here. `local` is (0.0, 0.0) and that is the honest
number for a self-hosted model: no per-token invoice exists. It is not a licence
to stop counting. Tokens are counted regardless, so pointing the composer at a
paid API and setting `ASSISTANT_PRICE_TIER` turns the same measurement into a
bill the merge gate can block on, with no new instrumentation.
