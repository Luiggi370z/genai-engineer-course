"""Workshop 6 layer — harden the assistant. Containment, not wishful filtering.

L1 decode+scan+redact on every untrusted string (incl. fetched emails/news),
spotlight untrusted content, and an output gate. Combined with the agent's HITL
+ least-privilege tools, a landed injection still can't fire a gated tool.

The scan is deliberately in two halves, because attackers work in two ways.

**Expansion** answers "what else does this text say?" — base64, percent-encoding
and HTML entities all let a payload travel as something that does not look like
a payload. Each decoding is APPENDED rather than substituted, so decoding can
only ever add evidence; a document that legitimately contains a base64 blob is
not rewritten out from under the reader.

**Squashing** answers "what does this text say if you stop respecting the
separators?" `1gn0re`, `i g n o r e`, `Ign<zero-width-space>ore` and `IGNORE`
are one word to a human and four different strings to a regex. Squashing
lowercases, folds Unicode compatibility forms, drops the invisible format
characters whose only purpose in an attack is to break a word up, folds the
common leet substitutions, and then deletes everything that is not a letter or
digit. Patterns matched against that surface are written without separators too.

Neither half makes the filter complete, and the bar is not "no injection ever
lands" — that bar cannot be met. The bar is that a landed injection cannot fire
an irreversible tool or leak PII, which is HITL's job, not this file's. What
this file buys is that the cheap obfuscations stop working, so an attacker has
to spend real effort to reach the part of the system that was designed assuming
they would.
