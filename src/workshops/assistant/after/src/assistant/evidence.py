"""`make evidence` — the course-wide engineering evidence log.

`report.py` measures the capstone. This measures **the course**: six dimensions
a reviewer actually asks about — quality, latency, cost, security, failure
recovery, and the decisions behind them — collected across all nine phases into
one page and one JSON manifest.

## Why absence is a status, not a gap in a table

The default for every claim is `unproven`, and an unproven claim is *printed*
rather than skipped. This is the whole design, and it is the difference between
a manifest and a checklist.

A checklist records what you say you did. Tick nine boxes and it reports nine
phases complete, whether you ran anything or not — which means it reports the
same thing for someone who did the work and someone who did not, and therefore
carries no information about either. This records what left a file behind. If
you never ran the phase-6 red-team, the security section says so, with the
command that would fix it. You cannot tick your way to a green page.

The consequence is worth stating plainly: **your first run of this will be
almost entirely red**, because you have not generated the artifacts yet. That is
the report working. A tool that flattered you on day one would have nothing left
to tell you on day ninety.

## Where the numbers come from

Capstone claims are measured live, in the same pass as `report.py`, so the
evidence log and the portfolio page cannot disagree about the system they both
describe. Every other claim reads a JSON file that some earlier phase wrote —
named, dated, and reproduced by exactly one command, which the page prints next
to the claim. Nothing here is typed by hand, because a hand-typed number in an
evidence log is the specific thing an evidence log exists to prevent.
