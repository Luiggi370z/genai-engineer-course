"""Workshop 4 layer — the assistant's tools. Every external connection is a tool.

Read-only tools run freely; anything that sends/schedules is gated behind
requires_approval. Connectors are stubbed (email/news/telegram/calendar) so the
whole thing runs offline; swap the bodies for real APIs via env-var credentials.

Two fields exist for the planner rather than for the caller, and both matter:

**The docstring is an interface.** planner.py selects a tool by matching the
goal's words against the tool's name and description, exactly as a
function-calling model does. A docstring that says only what the tool *is*
("Send a Telegram message") gives a planner nothing to match on; one that also
says when to reach for it ("use to message, notify or tell the team") is
selectable. Writing docs for the planner is not decoration — it is wiring.

**`required_args` is a contract.** The planner will not propose a call it cannot
fully specify, so a tool must declare which arguments it cannot do without.
Deriving them from the signature keeps the two from drifting.
