"""OAuth 2.1 + PKCE — how a token gets minted, as opposed to how it gets checked.

`auth.py` is the resource server: it verifies whatever arrives. This is the other
half, and it exists because "we support OAuth" is easy to claim and easy to get
subtly wrong. It is what `docker-compose.oauth.yml` puts in front of the
assistant, and it is stdlib-only for the same reason `connectors.py` is: one
HTTP POST and a SHA-256 do not justify a dependency.

The flow, and what each step is actually defending against:

1. **Discovery.** Fetch `/.well-known/openid-configuration` for the authorize,
   token and JWKS endpoints. Hard-coded endpoints break at the first realm
   rename; worse, they are how a service ends up validating against one issuer
   and redirecting to another.

2. **PKCE.** Generate a random `code_verifier`, send only its SHA-256
   (`code_challenge`), and reveal the verifier at token exchange. An attacker
   who steals the authorization code — off a redirect URL, out of a log, from a
   malicious app claiming the same custom scheme — cannot exchange it without
   the verifier, which never left the client. OAuth 2.1 makes this mandatory for
   every client, not just public ones, and `plain` is not an option here: a
   challenge equal to its verifier defends nothing.

3. **State.** A random value echoed back and compared, which is what makes a
   forged callback fail. It is a CSRF token for the redirect and nothing else;
   it is not PKCE, and having one does not excuse skipping the other.

4. **Exact redirect matching.** The URI is registered with the issuer and sent
   again at exchange. Prefix or wildcard matching is how a code gets delivered
   to somebody else's server.

What is deliberately NOT here: the assistant never forwards a caller's token to
an upstream service. That is the confused-deputy trap from
`phase7-mcp/03-auth-modes`, and the defence is architectural — a token minted
for this audience is spent here and nowhere else.
