"""Which system produced this number — derived, never typed.

Two consumers, one answer: `core.py` stamps the prompt version onto every
compose span, and `report.py` stamps model/prompt/corpus/dataset onto the report
the merge gate reads. They agree because they call the same functions.

The rule this file exists to enforce: **a version stamp is computed from the
thing it describes.** The alternative — `PROMPT_VERSION = "v3"` next to the
prompt — rots the first time someone edits the prompt in a hurry, and it rots
silently. Nothing fails, no test goes red; the label just stops being true, and
every comparison across that boundary quietly becomes a comparison between two
different systems wearing the same name.

Hashes are truncated to eight hex characters. That is 32 bits — plenty to notice
a change, not enough to be a cryptographic claim, and short enough that a person
can read one out in a review.

    says which commit is *serving*, and this says which source was *measured*. The
    release evidence carried a date and a list of model versions, and a date cannot
    say whether numbers describe the code about to be published or the tree from a
    fortnight ago — so `release.yml` had nothing to check and published anyway.

    Git object ids rather than a commit sha, because the evidence has to be
    committed *to* the release it certifies: a sha changes when the evidence file
    lands, a tree hash of the measured paths does not. So the maintainer can run the
    measurement, commit the result, and tag — and the binding still holds.

    Four answers, all of them honest:

      ``<8 hex>``         a clean checkout; this is the measured source.
      ``dirty-<8 hex>``   a checkout with uncommitted changes under those paths.
                          Prefixed rather than reported as a separate flag: a gate
                          that compares ids cannot forget to also check a boolean,
