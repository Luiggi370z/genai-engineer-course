"""When a request stops being worth doing.

Two ways that happens, and they deserve one answer rather than two:

**The budget ran out.** A request the caller will wait 30 seconds for should not
spend 90 seconds retrying. Without a shared budget, each layer enforces its own
timeout and they compose by *addition* — three retries of a 10-second call inside
a 60-second composer inside a 30-second request is a 30-second promise that takes
ninety. The arithmetic is never done by anyone, which is why it is always wrong.

**Nobody is listening.** The client disconnected, closed the tab, or hit its own
timeout ten seconds ago. Everything downstream — the model tokens, the retries,
the vector search — is now being paid for to produce an answer no one will read.
Under load this is the failure that compounds: the queue fills with work for
callers who left, which makes everyone slower, which makes more callers leave.

Both are the same question ("is this still worth doing?"), so they are one object
here. `Budget` carries an absolute monotonic deadline plus a `cancelled`
predicate, lives in a ContextVar, and is consulted at the seams: between pipeline
stages, before each retry, and before each streamed chunk.

Checked at seams, deliberately — not enforced by killing a thread. Python cannot
safely interrupt arbitrary code, and pretending otherwise produces a system that
leaks half-finished work. What it CAN do is refuse to start the next thing, which
turns an unbounded request into a bounded one and is most of the value.

`remaining()` is what makes the budget compose: `resilient` shrinks each attempt's
timeout to what is left, so a per-call timeout can never outlive the request that
owns it.
