"""The assistant itself — one pipeline, two delivery modes.

`Assistant` owns the request pipeline: screen the input, remember it, retrieve
and re-screen context, run the tool loop under a trace, then compose. `ask()`
returns the answer in one piece; `ask_stream()` yields it as SSE frames. Both
build on the same `_gather` so policy can never diverge between the two paths.

Every stage of that pipeline opens a child span under one `assistant.pipeline`
root (observe.py). This is not decoration. "The P99 is 4 seconds" is not a
finding, it is the start of an argument; "the P99 is 4 seconds and 3.6 of them
are in `llm.compose`" ends it. The stages also carry the attributes an operator
needs and a log line cannot give you: which model and prompt version answered,
how many documents came back and how many survived screening, what the exchange
cost, and whether the guardrail refused.

Everything here is deterministic and offline — the adapters that make it real
are chosen in service.py, and the HTTP surface lives in api.py.

        A document may arrive as prose or as `{"text": ..., "source": ...}`. The
        source is worth naming: it is what a citation points at, what
        `forget(source)` deletes, and what makes a re-ingest an update instead of
        a fourth copy. An unnamed document gets a source derived from its own
        content, so even the lazy path deduplicates.

        Retrieval-time screening (`screen_contexts`) already drops a poisoned
        document on its way to the composer, so this looks redundant. It is not,
        for three reasons.

        A payload that is only caught at retrieval is *stored*: it sits in the
        index, it comes back in every search that ranks it, and it is one
        detector regression away from being evidence. Storing it also means the
        blast radius of a later bug is the whole corpus rather than one request.

        PII is the second reason, and it is the sharper one. Redacting at
        retrieval keeps the raw SSN on disk forever; redacting at ingest means
        it was never written down. That is data minimisation, and it is the
        difference between a breach that exposes what you needed and one that
        exposes what you happened to keep.

        Third: the caller finds out. An `/ingest` that silently drops half a
        batch and reports success is how a corpus quietly ends up incomplete.

        None of which retires `screen_contexts` — documents can arrive by paths
        that never touch this method, and a detector that improves tomorrow has
        to be applied to what was written yesterday. Two gates, one screen.
