"""Irreversible effects, written down before they happen.

The gap this closes is small and permanent. An irreversible tool runs like this:

    approval_id = approvals.consume(...)   # the grant is now spent
    result = send_telegram(...)            # the message is now sent
    audit_log.record("tool.ran", ...)      # ...if we get this far

Every line is fine and the sequence is not, because the process can stop between
any two of them. Crash after line 2 and a message went out that nothing in the
system remembers: the grant is gone, the log is silent, and the only evidence is
in somebody else's inbox. That is not a rare-race-condition story — it is a
deploy that rolled during a send, an OOM kill, a `docker compose down`.

There is no way to make "spend the grant", "call the API" and "write the row" one
atomic operation; the API is not in our database. What CAN be atomic is the
*intent*. So the order becomes:

    reserve  → a durable `pending` row, committed BEFORE the call
    call     → the effect
    settle   → the same row marked `sent` or `failed`, with the outcome

Now a crash leaves a `pending` row, which is a question ("did this send?") rather
than silence. `pending()` lists them, so reconciliation is a query instead of an
archaeology project. This is the transactional-outbox pattern with the delivery
worker left out on purpose: automatic redelivery of a possibly-already-delivered
irreversible action is a *worse* default than telling a human, and the honest
version of this pattern at this scale is a list an operator can read.

The row is keyed by `(subject, tool, args_hash, request_id)`, which makes the
reserve itself idempotent: a retried request cannot open a second envelope for
the same call. `request_id` is in the key rather than out of it because two
deliberate sends of the same message are two different requests and both should
happen.
