"""`make report` — run the assistant on trial, then write it down twice.

A capstone you cannot show is a capstone you cannot claim. This module runs the
whole composed service offline (zero keys, deterministic) and writes one portfolio
page a reviewer can read in two minutes: eval scores per slice, red-team
containment results, latency percentiles read off the OTel spans, the cost story,
and the design decisions with their ADRs.

It also writes `report.json`, which is the same run in the shape the merge gate
reads (`phase8-deploy/02-ci`). The two outputs are not two measurements — they
are one `Measured` record rendered for two audiences, because a page a human
believes and a number CI enforces must never be able to disagree. A gate that
reads a committed fixture is checking that somebody remembered to edit a file;
this one blocks on what the code in front of it actually did.

Everything is measured, nothing is asserted: the eval scores come from
`evals.run_suite` over a golden set, the containment result from actually firing
the attacks at the service, the latency from the same spans `/health` counts.
The honesty rules of Phase 3 apply to your own portfolio hardest of all — the
judge is the offline KeywordJudge and the report says so, because a reviewer who
catches one inflated number stops believing the rest of the page.

The version stamps are DERIVED, never typed. `model` is the tier that ran,
`prompt` is a hash of `grounded_prompt`'s own source, `corpus` and `dataset` are
hashes of the inputs. Hand-written stamps rot silently — the number changes, the
label does not, and the report becomes a confident lie about which system it
describes.
