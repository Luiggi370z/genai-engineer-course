"""Optional Bearer-JWT auth for the service — the phase 7.3 checks, applied here.

Off by default: without a key source the service stays a zero-key local demo and
every request runs as the anonymous "local" identity. With one configured, every
mutating endpoint demands a token that survives six checks:

  1. signature — minted with a key we trust, using an algorithm we chose
  2. exp       — present AND not expired
  3. aud       — issued FOR THIS service, not passed through from another
  4. iss       — minted by the issuer we expect, when one is configured
  5. sub       — names a caller, because everything downstream is scoped by it
  6. scope     — grants the specific capability being exercised

Checks 2, 4 and 5 are the ones this originally got wrong, and they failed in the
most comfortable way possible: a token with no `exp` and no `sub` was *accepted*
and mapped to the shared anonymous identity. It looked like a working request.
What it actually was is a credential that never expires, spending memory and
approvals that belong to everyone at once. PyJWT verifies a claim if it is there
and shrugs if it is not, so "required" has to be said out loud — `require=` and
`options={"verify_..."}` are not the same setting, and only one of them makes a
missing claim an error.

Two key sources, one code path:

**Shared secret (HS256).** `ASSISTANT_JWT_SECRET`. Fine for a single service you
also mint tokens for; it means every verifier is also a forger.

**Issuer JWKS (RS256).** `ASSISTANT_JWKS_URL`. What an OAuth 2.1 deployment
actually looks like: the identity provider signs with a private key nobody else
holds, this service fetches the public half and only ever verifies. Rotation is
the issuer's problem, and a leaked verifier cannot mint anything.

Clock skew is a policy, not an accident. Two machines disagreeing by a second
should not 401 a valid token, so `ASSISTANT_JWT_LEEWAY` (default 60s) widens
`exp`/`nbf` — deliberately small, because leeway is also the window in which a
just-expired token still works.

The verified `sub` claim becomes the caller's identity — the hook that memory
namespacing, approval grants and the audit log all hang off.
