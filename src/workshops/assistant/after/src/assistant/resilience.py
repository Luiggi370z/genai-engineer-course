"""Reliability primitives — stdlib only, injectable clocks, no magic.

Three small pieces the service composes around its network adapters:

- resilient(fn, policy)  : retries with exponential backoff + full jitter, and a
                           per-call timeout enforced from a worker thread
- TokenBucket            : the classic rate limiter — capacity is the burst, the
                           refill rate is the sustained requests-per-second
- ConcurrencyCap         : an admission counter — over the cap means REJECT, not
                           queue, because a queued request still holds the caller

Everything takes an injectable clock/sleep so the tests run in microseconds and
never actually wait.

## What is worth retrying

`retry on Exception` is the default everyone writes and it is wrong in two
directions at once. It retries a `TypeError` three times — the bug is
deterministic, so all it buys is three times the latency before the same 500 —
and it retries a 400 from an API that will reject the same payload forever. Worse,
each pointless attempt holds a connection and a worker while the real incident is
somewhere else.

So a failure is classified before it is retried. `TRANSIENT` is the honest list:
the network, the clock, and the server saying "later". Everything else is a bug or
a refusal, and both should surface on the first attempt, where the stack trace
still points at the cause.

## What is worth retrying ONCE

Retrying is safe when the call is idempotent. `send_telegram` is not: a retry
after a timeout may deliver a second message, because a timeout tells you nothing
about whether the server acted. `ONCE` exists for that case, and side-effecting
adapters use it — the timeout still applies, the retries do not. Making that a
named policy rather than a comment is the difference between a rule and a hope.
