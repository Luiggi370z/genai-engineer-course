"""Memory, partitioned by verified identity.

Both memory stores already take a `user` and scope every read and write to it —
`SqliteMemory` filters on a `user` column, `AssistantMemory` keeps its own dict.
What was missing was anyone passing one. The service built a single store with
the default `user="me"` and distinguished callers only by writing
`source="user:alice"`, a label that `recall` does not look at. Alice's
preferences were one query away from Bob's answer.

The fix composes rather than modifies: hand this a factory, and it hands each
subject its own store. Isolation then comes from the store's existing scoping
instead of from a filter someone has to remember to apply at every call site —
and the two backends need no changes to gain it.

`all()` deliberately crosses tenants, because it is the operator's view: "what
has this service remembered". Recall never does.
