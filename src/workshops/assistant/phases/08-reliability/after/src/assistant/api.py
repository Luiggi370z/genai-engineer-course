"""The HTTP surface — every route, and nothing else.

`create_app` builds the FastAPI app around an assembled Assistant: the load-
shedding middleware at the door, the optional Bearer-JWT dependency on every
mutating route, and the endpoints (/health + /ready, /ingest, /ask + /ask/stream,
/approve). No business logic lives here — the routes translate HTTP in and out
of `Assistant` calls, which is why the whole surface is testable with a
TestClient and no network.

        Both live here because this is the only layer that knows either fact —
        the deadline is a property of the HTTP contract, and the disconnect is
        an ASGI event. Everything below reads them through a ContextVar
        (deadline.py) and stays synchronous.

        The watcher is a task rather than a check because a disconnect arrives
        as a message, not as a return value: `is_disconnected()` only becomes
        true once something has awaited the receive channel. Polling it from a
        sibling task is what lets a *synchronous* pipeline, running in the
        threadpool, notice that nobody is listening any more.

        The body is read here first, and that is not a stray optimisation. The
        watcher reads from the same receive channel the route does, so a poll
        that lands while the body is still in flight can take a body message and
        drop it — an intermittently empty request, which is about the worst bug
        shape there is. Reading first makes the middleware's request the owner of
        the body (Starlette replays the cached copy downstream) and leaves the
        channel with nothing on it but the disconnect the watcher is looking for.

        **The watcher outlives `call_next`, and for a streaming response that is
        the whole mechanism.** `call_next` returns as soon as the response OBJECT
        exists; the body is iterated afterwards, while the server sends it. So a
        watcher cancelled when `call_next` returns is a watcher cancelled before
        the client has had a chance to leave — which is what this used to do. The
        unit tests still passed, because they inject `cancelled=` by hand and
        prove the generator obeys it; nothing proved an ASGI disconnect ever set
        it. A real probe left after 0.8 seconds having read nothing and the server
        went on to drain all 200 source chunks for an audience of nobody.

        So the teardown moves onto the body iterator. The budget's ContextVar does
        NOT need the same treatment: `call_next` starts the downstream app in its
        own task, that task copies the context at creation — inside the `with`
        below — and a `reset` here cannot reach the copy. The flag it reads is this
        same `asyncio.Event`, so the only thing that was missing is somebody still
        polling. That asymmetry is worth knowing before editing either half.
