"""Answer composition — how evidence becomes prose, in every tier.

Tool planning stays deterministic everywhere (that is policy, and policy should
not depend on model mood); what the model tier changes is COMPOSITION. The
offline composer stitches retrieved context together; the Ollama composers write
grounded prose from the same evidence, batch or streamed. Both consume the same
`grounded_prompt`, and both cite the same `citations_for` ids, so swapping tiers
never changes the shape of an answer.

#: sees it; `without_refusal` and `stop_at_refusal` turn it into `ABSTAIN`.

#: The two used to be one string, and the prompt said "reply exactly: <sentence>".
#: Measured against `qwen3.5:9b` on the deployed stack, that produced an answer
#: with the refusal stapled to the end of it 6 to 8 times in 10 — on questions
#: with nothing ambiguous about them:
#:
#:     Travel expenses are reimbursed within ten business days of filing [c1].
#:     I don't know — that isn't in what I can see.
#:
#: A model that does that has not misjudged the evidence; it found the evidence,
#: answered from it, cited it, and then filled in what it took to be a required
#: field. One reply said as much in a parenthetical: "(Note: The second sentence
#: is required by the prompt's constraint format)".
#:
#: Four rewordings were measured over 8-10 trials each. None removed it, and the
#: most emphatic ("Answer or refuse — never both in one reply") made it worse by
#: turning contradictions into outright refusals of evidence the model had in
#: front of it. So the instruction is no longer asked to carry the contract. A
#: sentinel is a word an answer cannot accidentally contain, which makes the same
#: mistake detectable instead of merely discouraged, and `stop_at_refusal` cuts
#: the reply there. The model still appends it; nobody downstream can tell.
