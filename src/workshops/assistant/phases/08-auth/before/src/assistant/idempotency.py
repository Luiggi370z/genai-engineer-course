"""Idempotency keys for every side effect — a SQLite dedupe table.

A client that retries a timed-out request is a well-behaved client: a timeout
tells it nothing about whether the server acted, so asking again is the only
correct move. It is also the move that grants a second approval, ingests a batch
twice, or deletes a source that had been re-added in between. The server has to
be the one that makes the retry safe, because the client genuinely cannot.

The mechanism is the standard one: the client sends an `Idempotency-Key`, the
server records it, and a key it has seen is acknowledged without re-applying the
effect. Two details separate a real implementation from a decorative one.

**The stored answer is the ORIGINAL answer.** Returning `{"replayed": true}` and
nothing else technically avoids the double effect and still breaks the client,
which asked a question and got a receipt. `run()` stores the first result and
replays it verbatim, so a retry is indistinguishable from the call it repeats —
which is the entire promise of the word "idempotent".

**A failure is not recorded.** If the operation raises, the key is released, so
the retry the client is about to send actually runs. Recording the key up front
would turn one transient failure into a permanent one: every retry cheerfully
acknowledged, the effect never applied, and nothing in the logs saying so.

Keys are namespaced by subject and operation before they get here (`api.py`).
They are chosen by clients, and one tenant's `"retry-1"` must not swallow
another's.

The table lives in the same SQLite file as memory when ASSISTANT_DB is set, so
replay protection survives a restart; without it, an in-process `:memory:` table
covers the single-process demo.
