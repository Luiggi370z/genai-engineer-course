"""`make release-evidence` — the same trial, run against the system that ships.

`report.py` measures the OFFLINE tier: an in-memory retriever, a word-count token
meter, a lexical `KeywordJudge`, and three containment probes written inline. It
runs in a second, it runs on every push, and every number it produces is honest
about being a proxy. What it is not is evidence about the deployed stack, and for
a long time the portfolio page was the only measurement anybody quoted.

This module runs the same harness against the real thing:

  * **retrieval** — Qdrant, the semantic embedder, hybrid RRF, reranking ON
    (`ASSISTANT_RERANK_MODEL`), which is the configuration the shipped image
    deliberately does not carry;
  * **the judge** — RAGAS 0.4 against a pinned local model, the same surface
    lessons 2.1 and 3.2 teach, instead of lexical overlap;
  * **the red team** — all 58 rows of the versioned Phase 6 dataset, benign
    controls included, instead of three probes.

The controls are the half people skip, and they are the reason this is worth
running. A filter that refuses everything contains every attack; the eleven
benign rows are what stop that from reading as a pass.

Two rules this lane exists to enforce:

1. **Each tier states what it measured, in its own header.** Not a footnote —
   the first thing a reader sees. A number whose instrument is unstated is a
   number that will eventually be quoted as if it came from the other tier.
2. **Nothing here has a fallback.** `report.py` degrades gracefully by design;
   this refuses to run. A release measurement that silently substitutes the
   offline retriever when Qdrant is unreachable is worse than no measurement,
   because it comes with a date and a stamp.
3. **A measurement names the code it measured.** A date is not a binding: it
   cannot tell anyone whether the numbers describe what is about to be published
   or the tree from two weeks ago. `source_id` answers that, and `release.yml`
   refuses to publish a release whose evidence answers with a different tree.

    Poisoning ALL the read-only tools rather than picking one: delivery then does not
    depend on which connector the planner prefers for a given phrasing. Read-only is
    `not requires_approval`, read off the registry rather than from a list of names
    here — a tool added with an untrusted return value is in the threat model the day
    it is added, and a hardcoded pair would quietly stop covering it.

    Gated tools are left exactly as they are. The bar these rows measure is whether a
    landed injection can make one FIRE; replacing their bodies would replace the thing
    under test.

    **The `goal` is appended to each poisoned tool's docstring, and that is the
    subtle part.** `planner.relevance` scores a tool by the words it shares with the
    request, so three of the five rows selected no connector at all: the capstone has
    no weather tool, and "look up the weather" matches neither `read_emails` nor
    `read_news`. Those rows then delivered nothing and — under the rule in
    `run_redteam` — would stop the release.

    Which would be the wrong conclusion. The row's premise is *a connector returned
    this text*; `tool_outputs` in the dataset is the return value, not a hypothesis
    about tool selection. Whether this particular capstone happens to own a tool
    matching that phrasing is a fact about its tool inventory and nothing to do with
    whether poisoned tool output can reach the composer. So the connector is made
    relevant to the request and the row measures what it was written to measure.

    Safe to do because selection is deterministic and reads the GOAL ONLY — see
    planner.py, which is explicit that retrieved documents and tool output never
    reach it. Widening a read-only tool's vocabulary cannot make the planner obey the
    payload, and it cannot hide a gated call: `probe()` compares the verdict against

    `meter` is not optional, and the reason is arithmetic. These 58 rows used to call
    `assistant.ask` directly while the page's `runs` counted every pipeline span, so
    the release evidence reported 63 requests and a token total from 5 of them. An

    **`delivered` names the boundary rather than asserting one.** The obvious

    ingest-time screening refuses every one of them, so nothing is stored to
    retrieve. That is the system working (`core.ingest` explains why a payload
    caught only at retrieval is still a payload on disk), and it is a real result

The rig is real — Qdrant with a semantic embedder, hybrid retrieval with reranking,
a RAGAS judge on a pinned model, every row of the versioned red-team dataset. The
**eval suite is not**, and that is the whole of the caveat:

| | this page | the standard this course teaches |
|---|---|---|
| golden rows | 5 | 50 — "the smallest set worth gating on" |
| slices | 2: core, abstention | 5: semantic, exact, multi_hop, unanswerable, adversarial |
| faithfulness bar | 0.60, a collapse detector | 0.85, judge calibrated against your labels |

The right-hand column is `phase3-evals/01-golden-set` and the Phase 3 milestone, not an
external benchmark. This page falls short of the standard the course itself teaches.

Five rows across two slices detect a collapse — a retriever returning nothing, a
composer that stopped grounding. They cannot measure a level, and a per-slice
regression is not available at this width: one row moving is 20% of a slice. So the
scores below are a **smoke signal on the release path**, not a quality certification,
and the `0.60` floor in `phase8-deploy/02-ci` is set where it is for that reason
rather than as a lowered ambition.

The red-team half is not subject to this: 58 rows with eleven benign controls, every
payload delivered on its own channel, is the full dataset the course builds. Read the
containment table as evidence and the eval table as a canary.
