"""The model-in-the-loop guard: what it may do, and what it must never do.

Every test here is offline. The guard is a callable returning a bool, so a
"model" that always says INJECTION, or always errors, or takes the scenic route
through a prompt-injection attempt of its own, is three lines of Python — and
testing the WIRING is the point. Whether a given 9B model classifies well is a
question for the eval suite; whether a well-behaved answer can unblock something
the deterministic screen refused is a question for this file, and the answer
must be no regardless of which model you plug in.
