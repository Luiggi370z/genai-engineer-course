"""Persistent audit log — who did what, decided by which policy, backed by SQLite.

The agent's per-request `audit` list answers "what happened in THIS run"; this
log answers the operator's question a week later: which identity asked for the
send, when was it approved, what did the guardrails block.

## Why a row is more than a sentence

The first version of this table was `(at, kind, subject, detail)`, and `detail`
was prose — `"send_telegram (approval 9f2c…)"`. It reads well and it answers
nothing. Every real question asked of an audit log is a JOIN:

    "this trace looks wrong, what did it DO?"        -> by trace id
    "the customer says we messaged them twice"       -> by args hash
    "which approval authorized this?"                -> by approval id
    "show me everything in request abc123"           -> by request id

Prose cannot be joined on, and the moment somebody needs to they will write a
regex over `detail` — which works until the format changes, at which point the
trail silently stops matching and nobody notices, because a query returning zero
rows looks exactly like nothing having happened.

So every kind writes the same **columns**, and each is bound to the same request
the spans are:

    request_id   joins the row to the API response and to the log line
    trace_id     joins it to the span tree, so "what did this trace do" is a query
    subject      the VERIFIED identity, never one from a request body
    approval_id  which grant authorized this, for the rows where one did
    args_hash    canonical fingerprint — the same call written two ways matches
    result       ok / blocked / pending / rejected — the outcome as a value

`detail` survives as free text for the human reading the trail, but nothing
queries it.

## Kinds recorded by the service

    policy.blocked      input refused by guardrails (result=blocked)
    ingest.rejected     a document refused AT INGEST, so it was never stored
    corpus.ingested     documents added to a tenant's corpus (result=ok)
    corpus.deleted      a source removed from a tenant's corpus
    tool.pending        a gated tool paused for approval (result=pending)
    tool.ran            any tool executed inside the agent loop
    approval.granted    /approve minted one single-use grant
    approval.replayed   a mutation replayed (idempotency key already seen)

Shares the ASSISTANT_DB file when configured, so the trail survives a restart
alongside memory, approvals, the idempotency table and the outbox.
