"""Eval-suite layer — put the RAG core on trial and block merges that regress it.

This is the layer every later workshop plugs into instead of re-inventing: the memory
workshop adds recall rows, the hardening workshop adds red-team rows, the deploy
workshop wires `gate()` into the pipeline.

Three design rules carried over from phase 3, and worth stating because they are what
make an eval suite survivable:

  * **The judge is injected.** `Judge` is a protocol; the offline suite uses a
    deterministic stub. Only the nightly run needs a model, so the gate is cheap
    enough to run on every push — which is the only reason it ever runs at all.
  * **Abstention is scored without a judge.** "Did it refuse?" is a string check on
    the slice the business cares about most.
  * **Score per slice.** An overall mean hides a collapsed slice, and the collapsed
    slice is always the interesting one.

`agreement` and `cohen_kappa` are inlined here (they are eight lines of counting) so
the workshop stays dependency-free; `phase3-evals/03-judge-calibration` uses
`sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score`, which is what you would import at work.
