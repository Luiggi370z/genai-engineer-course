"""Real connectors — env-gated replacements for the stubs in tools.py.

The stubs stay the default so the whole capstone runs with zero keys. When the
env var is present, `build_assistant` swaps the tool BODY and nothing else: the
approval gate on send_telegram and the output re-screen on read_news apply to
the real connector exactly as they did to the stub, because policy lives in the
registry and the hardening wrapper, not in the connector.

Both connectors are stdlib-only (urllib + xml.etree) — no new dependencies for
one HTTP POST and one RSS parse.

## Raise inward, apologise outward

Each connector is two functions: an inner one that RAISES on failure and an
outer one that turns the failure into the friendly shape the tool contract
promises. The retry wrapper goes between them, and it has to, because a
connector that catches its own `OSError` and returns `{"error": ...}` is a
connector nothing can retry — from the outside a returned error dict is a
successful call. That is how a retry policy ends up decorative: present in the
code, never once triggered.

The split also puts the classification where the knowledge is. A 4xx from the
Bot API is `Permanent` (the same payload will be rejected again); a 5xx or a
dead socket is not. `resilience.py` cannot know that; this module can.

## Retried, and retried ONCE

`read_news` is a GET: retrying it costs a little latency and nothing else.
`send_telegram` is a send, and a timeout does not tell you whether the message
went out — retrying it is how one alert becomes three. So it gets `ONCE`: the
timeout still applies, the second attempt does not happen, and the outbox
(outbox.py) records the ambiguity for a human instead of guessing.
