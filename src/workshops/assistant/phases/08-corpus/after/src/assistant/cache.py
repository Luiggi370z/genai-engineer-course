"""Workshop 8 layer — caching an *agent's* answers, which is not like caching RAG.

A RAG answer is a pure function of a question and a corpus, so caching it is
arithmetic. An agent run is not pure: it sends messages, books calendar entries and
pauses for humans. Replay a cached answer for a request whose original run fired
`send_telegram` and you have either skipped a message the user expected, or — if you
cache the *request* rather than the answer — sent it twice.

So this module's real content is the refusal rules, not the dictionary:

  - a run that fired an **irreversible** tool is never cached;
  - a run **paused for approval** is never cached (it isn't an answer yet);
  - a run that **failed** is never cached;
  - and the key covers everything that changes the answer, including the day, for
    anything time-sensitive.

Caching is rung 2 of the Phase-8 ladder — behaviour-preserving *only if* you get
these rules right. Get them wrong and it is the most damaging rung, because the
failure is invisible: the assistant answers instantly and confidently with
something that is no longer true.
