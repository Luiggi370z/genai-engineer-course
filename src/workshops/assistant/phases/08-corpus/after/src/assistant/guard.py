"""A model in the loop, as a SECOND opinion on the deterministic screen.

`guardrails.screen` is regex and normalisation: fast, free, auditable, and blind
to any attack phrased in a way nobody wrote a pattern for. A small local model
reads for intent instead of shape, which catches the novel phrasing — and misses
things the regex would have caught, invents refusals for benign text, costs a
round trip on every screened string, and can itself be argued with. Neither one
is the answer. Composing them is, and only in one direction.

**The guard can add a block. It can never remove one.**

That is the whole design, and it is not a detail. A guard that could clear a
deterministic block would be an appeal court an attacker gets to address: the
text under review IS the adversary's input, so "convince the reviewer" is one of
the moves available. Wiring it as an AND — blocked if either says blocked —
means the worst a compromised guard can do is refuse too much, which is an
availability problem you will hear about, rather than a security one you will
not.

**It fails open to the deterministic verdict.**

If the model is down, slow, or answers something unparseable, the base verdict
stands. This is a real trade-off, stated deliberately: failing closed would let
an Ollama restart take the whole service down, and the layers that actually
contain a landed injection — HITL on irreversible tools, least privilege,
per-tenant scoping — do not depend on this file at all. The guard is depth, not
the floor. If your threat model says otherwise, invert it here and accept the
availability cost knowingly.

**Its input is untrusted, and so is its output.**

The text being screened is exactly the text that wants to be treated as an
instruction, so it is spotlighted going in. The reply is matched against one
exact token: a model that starts explaining itself must not accidentally trip
the gate, and must not accidentally clear it either. Anything that is not a
clean verdict is no verdict.

Off by default. `ASSISTANT_GUARD_MODEL` turns it on, and the cost of that is one
extra model call per untrusted string — question, retrieved document, tool
output — which is why it is a decision rather than a default.
