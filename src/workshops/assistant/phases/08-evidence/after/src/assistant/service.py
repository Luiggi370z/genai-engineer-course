"""Composition root — the capstone. `build_assistant` wires every layer built
across the workshops into one running thing:

    request -> auth (optional Bearer JWT, env-gated)      [api.py]
            -> screen (input; guard.py adds a model when configured)
                                                          [core.py]
            -> agent.run loop  (observe span)             [core.py]
                 -> tools (screening.py re-screens read-only content)
                 -> RAG (offline BM25 or Qdrant)          [adapters.py]
                 -> memory (in-process or SQLite)
            -> compose (offline stitcher or Ollama)       [composers.py]
                 -> degraded fallbacks on failure         [fallbacks.py]
            -> guardrails.output_ok (response)            [core.py]

Everything is offline and deterministic by default, so the fast tier drives the
real FastAPI app (api.py) with a TestClient and no network. Setting the env vars
in settings.py swaps in the real adapters HERE, without touching the logic in
any other module — that is the whole point of composing against interfaces.
