"""The planner reads the registry, not a hardcoded list.

The bug these tests exist to prevent is subtle and was shipped: Workshop 7
discovered tools from an MCP server and merged them into the registry, and the
planner — which knew two tool names by heart — could never pick one. Every test
here is really the same question asked from a different angle: can a tool that
did not exist when this file was written be chosen, called, and refused?
