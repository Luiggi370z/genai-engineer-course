Finding things is the part that demos well. The parts that decide whether the
system survives a year in production are the ones tested here: does re-ingesting
a document update it or duplicate it, can you delete something, does a citation
still resolve to the text it named, and does the poisoned page get dropped
without taking the provenance of the clean ones with it.
