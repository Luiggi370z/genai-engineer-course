"""The outbound trust boundary — nothing leaves before the gate has seen it.

`screening.py` guards what comes *in*. This guards what goes *out*, and the
streaming case is where that gets interesting.

The naive streaming shape yields each chunk as it arrives and screens the joined
answer at the end. That gate cannot do its job: by the time it fires, the PII is
already rendered in the caller's browser and sitting in their proxy logs. A
`done` event announcing "actually that was redacted" is a notification, not a
control.

Buffering the whole answer fixes it and throws away streaming. The middle is to
release only the prefix of the answer that no still-forming match could reach
back into. Getting that condition right took three attempts, and the two failures
are worth more than the fix.

**Attempt one** kept back a round 256 characters and a comment calling it "far
more than enough". The email pattern had an unbounded `+`, so it could match a
span of any length; a long local part pushed the start of the address out of the
window and onto the wire.

**Attempt two** bounded every pattern and *derived* the window from those bounds
— `HOLDBACK_CHARS` is the longest span any `guardrails.PII` entry can match. That
fixed the stated premise and left the real one unstated. Bounding the email regex
to 64 characters of local part means an over-long address still matches, but only
on its **last** 64 characters; the hundreds of characters in front of that are
part of no match at all, so nothing held them. A 1000-character local part
released 608 characters of itself and then blocked the terminal event, which is
the same leak wearing the previous fix as a costume.

The mistake both times was reasoning about **matches** when the thing that must
not escape is a **candidate**. Before the `@` arrives, the gate cannot know
whether the run of characters it is holding is a word or the front half of an
address. So the release rule now rests on two bounds and takes the tighter:

1. **the span bound** — a character older than `HOLDBACK_CHARS` cannot be
   extended into a new match, because no pattern can match that far; and
2. **the token bound** — a character before the start of the trailing
   *unterminated* candidate run cannot be part of a match that is still forming,
   because no pattern can match across a `DELIMITER`.

Either one alone would be sufficient today. Keeping both means a future edit has
to break two independent invariants to leak, and both are proved mechanically
rather than asserted in prose: `test_stream.py` derives each pattern's true
maximum span from its compiled form, and walks its parse tree to prove it can
consume no delimiter. A pattern that cannot state a bound, or that could match
across a space, fails the suite instead of quietly widening the hole.

The cost is honest and bounded. Ordinary prose is full of delimiters, so the
token bound is nearly free — the gate holds the word being typed. Adversarial
input is where it bites: a single unbroken 4000-character token is held in full
until something terminates it, which is to say the gate degrades to full
buffering exactly when full buffering is what safety requires. `ASSISTANT_STREAM_MODE=raw`
remains available for local work where none of this is worth paying for —
documented as local-only, because with it the gate becomes a notification again.

The other terminal event here is `truncated`. A model that dies halfway through
leaves a grammatical fragment that reads like a whole answer; presenting it as
one is its own kind of dishonesty, so the gate distinguishes "this is the answer"
from "this is as far as the answer got".
