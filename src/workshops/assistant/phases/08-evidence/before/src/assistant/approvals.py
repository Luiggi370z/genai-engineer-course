"""Approval grants — one human "yes" authorizes one exact call, once.

The tempting implementation is a boolean (or a counter) keyed by tool name. It is
also wrong in four separate ways, and each one is a real incident:

    grants["send_telegram"] = True

  * **Anyone's yes works.** Alice approves; Bob's request finds the flag set and
    sends. The grant never named who it was for.
  * **Any arguments work.** The approval was for `{"chat_id": "team"}`; the flag
    also authorizes `{"chat_id": "the-press"}`.
  * **It never expires.** Last Tuesday's approval fires today's send.
  * **Two requests can spend it.** Check-then-execute-then-decrement is a
    read-modify-write; under concurrency both callers read `True`.

So a grant here is a *record*, not a flag: it names the subject, the tool, a
fingerprint of the exact arguments, and an expiry. Execution CONSUMES it with a
single `DELETE ... RETURNING`, which SQLite runs atomically — two concurrent
callers race for one row and exactly one wins. The loser sees no grant and pauses
for approval, which is the correct answer to "may I run this again?".

The store shares the ASSISTANT_DB file with memory, audit and idempotency, so an
outstanding approval survives a restart with everything else.
