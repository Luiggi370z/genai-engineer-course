"""TODO: write the regression tests that catch three defects this code shipped.

`defects/variants.py` holds the vulnerable versions, running, with their real
interfaces. `make defect-lab` runs this file twice per defect, in this order:

1. Against the current code, with `DEFECT` unset. Your tests must **pass**.
2. With that defect seeded (`DEFECT=<name>`). The same tests must **fail**.

Green first, then red. A red run only counts if the test was able to pass.
An unwritten test, a bad import, or a collection error also looks red, and
those are not a caught defect.

## Why the order is the lesson

Write the assertion before you study the fix. A test written after the fix is
green the moment it exists, so it never shows that it *can* go red. The lab
is what tells a real regression test apart from one that asserts something
beside the point.

## Assert the property, not the fix

None of these should reach for an implementation detail — do not count SQL
statements, do not check that `ApprovalStore` has a `_lock`. State what a user
cares about: Bob cannot spend Alice's approval, two racing requests send one
message, nothing crosses the boundary before the gate sees it, the image is
built from a pinned lockfile. A test written against the *fix* goes green on
the next refactor and stays green through the next regression.

## The three defects

1. **unbound-approval** — `defects.variants.CountingApprovalStore`, a counter
   keyed by tool name. Get it through `harness.approval_store()`. Four separate
   holes: any subject, any arguments, no expiry, and a read-modify-write two
   callers can both win. Four tests, one per hole; the names must start with
   `test_unbound_approval_`.
2. **pre-gate-stream** — emit-then-judge streaming, still in the codebase as
   `output_gate.RAW`. Get the mode from `harness.stream_mode()`. Prove no chunk
   containing blocked content is released — and then prove the fix did not just
   buffer everything, or you have traded a real hole for a fake fix. Names start
   with `test_pre_gate_stream_`.
3. **lockless-build** — an image built with no lockfile. Get the text from
   `harness.dockerfile()`. Prove the build installs from a committed lock, and
   that the base images are pinned. Names start with `test_lockless_build_`.

`test_the_lab_covers_every_seeded_defect` below checks the naming, so a defect
you skipped cannot pass unnoticed.

Reference: ../../after/defects/test_regressions.py — after you have been red.
