"""Composition settings — one place that reads the environment.

The whole capstone runs offline and deterministic by default. Each real adapter
turns on only when its env var is present, so the fast tier can never accidentally
reach the network and CI stays free:

    ASSISTANT_DB                  -> SQLite-backed memory instead of in-process dict
    QDRANT_URL                    -> QdrantStore instead of the offline BM25 RagStore
    OLLAMA_HOST                   -> Ollama brain instead of the rule-based planner
    ASSISTANT_PROVIDER            -> name the brain outright: ollama | openai | anthropic
                                     | offline. Unset keeps the rule above. A hosted
                                     provider without its key is a boot error, never a
                                     quiet downgrade — see providers.py
    ASSISTANT_CHAT_MODEL          -> the model tag for a hosted provider (no default:
                                     guessing one bills you for a model you did not pick)
    ASSISTANT_EMBED_PROVIDER      -> ollama (default) | openai. Chosen separately from
                                     the chat provider and never inferred from it
    MCP_SERVER                    -> discover tools from a real MCP server
    ASSISTANT_MCP_READONLY_ALLOWLIST -> discovered tools the operator has reviewed as reads
                                     (the only thing that can ungate one; a server saying
                                     so about itself cannot)
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT   -> ship spans over OTLP as well as keeping them in memory
    ASSISTANT_JWT_SECRET          -> require a Bearer JWT (HS256, shared secret)
    ASSISTANT_JWKS_URL            -> verify RS256 tokens against an issuer's JWKS instead
    ASSISTANT_JWT_ISSUER          -> also require this `iss` claim
    ASSISTANT_JWT_LEEWAY          -> clock-skew tolerance on exp/nbf (default 60s)
    ASSISTANT_APPROVAL_TTL        -> seconds a human approval stays spendable (default 300)
    ASSISTANT_STREAM_MODE         -> "raw" emits chunks before the output gate (local only)
    ASSISTANT_GUARD_MODEL         -> a second-opinion guard model on every untrusted string
    ASSISTANT_EMBED_MODEL         -> real embeddings (via Ollama) instead of the hash vector
    ASSISTANT_PRICE_TIER          -> which price list `make report` costs a run against
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN            -> send_telegram talks to the real Telegram Bot API
    NEWS_FEED_URL                 -> read_news fetches a real RSS feed (keyless)
    RATE_LIMIT_RPS (+_BURST)      -> token-bucket rate limit on every non-health route
    MAX_CONCURRENCY               -> reject (503) beyond this many in-flight requests
    REQUEST_DEADLINE_SECONDS      -> one budget per request; every layer's timeout fits inside it
    COMPOSE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS       -> how long one composition may take before the offline
                                     stitcher answers instead (default 60; raise it for a
                                     CPU-only container, where a 9B needs minutes)

Nothing here imports a heavy library; the adapters do that lazily when selected.
