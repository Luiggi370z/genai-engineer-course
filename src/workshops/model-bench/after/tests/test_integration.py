"""The opt-in tier: the same bench, against a model that really answers.

    make test-integration        # needs `ollama serve` and `ollama pull qwen3.5:8b`

Everything the fast tier proves is structural. This tier proves the one thing a
fake cannot: that a real small model, handed a real messy invoice, produces
something your schema accepts. Expect it to be slower and occasionally worse than
you hoped — that number is the point of the exercise.
