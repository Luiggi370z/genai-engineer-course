"""Two renderings of the same run: one for a human, one for CI.

Given to you whole — column alignment is not the lesson. Note that both functions
call `rank()`, so they stay broken until `core.rank` works.

The JSON is not a nicety. A bench whose output only exists in a terminal cannot
be diffed between two weeks, which means it cannot catch the day a vendor quietly
swaps your model for a cheaper one.
